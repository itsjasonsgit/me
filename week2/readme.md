TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Not sure if copy.copy() is the best way to get lists to not reference one another each loop. But.. it works.

Not sure why the tests aren't passing for the flowchart exercise. Should work fine. Wrote it my own way/bens way and had the same issue.
